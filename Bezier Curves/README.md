# **Bezier Curves**
This program renders an approximation of a parametric curve known as the Bézier using openGL. Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the convex hull of its control points, the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. 
Skeleton code was provided by Professor Tamar Shinar, CS130 UCR. I implemented snippets such as the control points, GL_mouse(), and GL_render().

To run this program, there is a makefile. Simply running 'make' will create the executable file 'bezier'.
Run
./bezier
