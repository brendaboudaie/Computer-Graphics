# **Particle Simulation**
This program simulates a volcanic erruption by rendering particles. The particles flow through numerical integration (Explicit Euler integration), and simulate particle behaviour through force sources (f = ma).
Skeleton code for this project was provided by Professor Tamar Shinar, CS130 UCR. I implemented snippets such as: the struct particle, the draw event function, and Euler Step function.

To run this program, there is a makefile. Simply running 'make' will create the executable file 'particle.  
Run  
./particle  

A simulated model of a volcanic erruption will appear.
