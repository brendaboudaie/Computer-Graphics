# **Ray-Tracing Algorithm** 
This program runs a simple ray tracing algorithm, generating different images from txt files.  
Skeleton code was provided to me from Professor Tamar Shinar, CS130 UCR. I implemented a handful of functions, such as camera possition, cast ray, and sphere/plane intersections.

The program is separated into tests. To run:  
./ray_tracer -i <test-num>

This will update the image in 'output.png'
Correct images are shown in tests.png
